I'm sorry, but this plugin was created for [WebMan design accessibility ready themes](https://www.webmandesign.eu/project-tag/accessibility-ready/). It does not work with other 3rd party themes.

If you are using one of the compatible themes (all themes since Cindy), the plugin also requires WooCommerce plugin to be active.

This plugin replaces theme's default generic search form with WooCommerce products search form. If you would still like to use the default search form, disable the *"Replace theme search"* option in **Appearance → Customize → WooCommerce → Product Catalog**.
